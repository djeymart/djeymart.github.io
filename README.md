The “NFT Mining Farm” represents a computing power division of a mining farm using carbon-free energy and located in France.
A mining farm is made up of several dozen ASICs and offers global computing power of one or more algorithms.
For the first “NFT Mining Farm”, we will use a mining farm composed of 30 AntMiner L3 + each offering a power of 500 MHS and working on the “Scrypt” algorithm.
This algorithm is used to mine the Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchain by “Merged mining”. The mining report is 2000 DOGE for 1 LTC mined.
